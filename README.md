 ### Getting Started :-
* To get started with the application, clone the repository to your local machine using :
      
      git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/spring-boot-blog.git
* Make sure you have Java and Maven installed on your machine.
You will also need a MySQL server running on your local machine or a remote server.
* Configure the database connection in the application.properties file:
       spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/<database-name>
       spring.datasource.username=<database-username>
       spring.datasource.password=<database-password>
* Build and run the application.
## There are Three models -
 * Users
 * Post
 * Comment
  
  ## Data Flow
1. The user sends a request to the application through the API endpoints.
2. The API receives the request and sends it to the appropriate controller method.
3. The controller method makes a call to the method in service class.
4. The method in service class builds logic and retrieves or modifies data from the database, which is in turn given to controller class
5. The controller method returns a response to the API.
6. The API sends the response back to the user.
